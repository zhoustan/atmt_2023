Today is a new day@@ !
I want you to get started right away.
Do you see the six windows on the fac@@ ad@@ e?
One should be respec@@ t@@ ful of other@@ 's beli@@ ef@@ s rather than mo@@ ck them.
People usually die if you kill them.
It was working.
Tom needs us to show him the way.
Just do your job.
The train was about to leave the station.
Here is an atom@@ ic power pl@@ ant.
When the al@@ ar@@ m clock goes off@@ , I don@@ ’@@ t mo@@ ve.
This feels like sil@@ k.
A traffic accident happened there.
Tom didn't do that very much.
Tom had just one word to cut so that out of this sent@@ ence, for@@ ever, disappear@@ ed our Mary.
We im@@ port coffee from Brazil.
But you cannot understand. How could you understand what it is to feel ol@@ d?
Why do I believe you?
You spread your af@@ fai@@ r@@ s too thin.
Those box speak@@ ers have a good re@@ ver@@ b.
They were hanging on her words.
Instead of complain@@ ing, may@@ be you should help.
I think we can handle that.
I am deeply interested in art.
You are old enough to know this.
I accepted his invitation.
I'd like to hear you sing your new song.
The children are going to the be@@ ach today.
Can you believe this is really happen@@ ing?
He paid the lo@@ an with inter@@ est.
I know you like chocolate.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
The de@@ er was running by it@@ self.
For him, divor@@ ce is a good invention, with one so@@ le dis@@ advant@@ ag@@ e@@ : you have to get married first.
The bi@@ parti@@ s@@ an comm@@ is@@ si@@ on@@ 's recomm@@ end@@ ations were ignor@@ ed.
I wasn't told where we were going.
That's doub@@ t@@ ful.
She intended to become an ac@@ tr@@ ess.
He is always ex@@ pres@@ si@@ on@@ less.
He has travel@@ ed around the world in eighty days by himself.
B@@ l@@ a@@ me it on the weather.
I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you!
Shame on you for your dis@@ courag@@ ement@@ !
He left the room without saying a word.
I'd like to get medic@@ al insur@@ ance.
He went down the h@@ ill.
The girls gi@@ gg@@ led.
Is anybody there?
I'm not scared of wom@@ en.
The angry mo@@ b over@@ turned cars and smashed stor@@ e@@ front windows.
I res@@ ig@@ n.
I know he is busy.
The man and his hor@@ se that fell off the c@@ lif@@ f were soon rescu@@ ed.
She is very c@@ un@@ ning.
It was a com@@ promise.
He is ap@@ t to for@@ g@@ et.
A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
Turn right at the next inter@@ section.
You look busy.
They all laughed at their err@@ or.
Tom didn't eat the apple you gave him.
Birds have n@@ est@@ s, spi@@ der@@ s have web@@ s, and hum@@ ans have friendship.
T@@ en years have gone by.
I'm trappe@@ d.
Marie re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant@@ ly takes another piece of cake.
I left behind some important docu@@ ments for the company at home. Sor@@ ry, but could you please go and get them for me now?
"@@ L@@ ist@@ en to me@@ ," said the Dem@@ on, plac@@ ing his hand upon my head.
You should have stopped.
He s@@ pr@@ ained his ank@@ le.
Tom looks older than he really is.
I was watching the scene hol@@ ding my breath.
Mary got to know her boyfriend in Paris.
Hand in your pap@@ ers.
Are you still married?
You must pay in adv@@ ance.
In K@@ ab@@ y@@ li@@ a, we speak the K@@ abyle language.
She turned a page of her book.
Yes, you should wear red li@@ p@@ sti@@ ck for V@@ al@@ ent@@ in@@ e's day.
Tom isn't invited to parties often.
You see the words that I ty@@ ped on the scre@@ en, but you don't see the tear@@ s that I sh@@ ed over the key@@ bo@@ ard.
Give me a ti@@ p.
What do you want to drink with your me@@ al?
She lives near the beach.
I want to live in a cast@@ le.
Don't you see the pat@@ tern@@ ?
I don't date.
Be respec@@ t@@ ful.
He can swim fast.
He saw a pretty girl.
The windows were open.
Tom wanted to go home early.
I forgot my de@@ bit card at home.
You're trus@@ t@@ wor@@ th@@ y.
Mary threw a pot@@ ato through the window.
Everyone deserves a second chance.
I find that it's best to find a happy bal@@ ance between origin@@ ality and sti@@ c@@ king to a strict stand@@ ard.
I remember meeting her somewhere.
I'm br@@ inging home a pizz@@ a.
Here is where it all happens.
So@@ on your efforts will be re@@ war@@ ded.
Is the coffee ho@@ t?
Thanks for jo@@ in@@ ing us.
It's a p@@ ity that you can't travel with us.
I wonder what happened to Pau@@ l.
You know where to find me if you need anything.
No one knows his name.
I'm on to you.
It's blowing very hard.
I didn't know you were still here.
We talked about everything we could think about.
I don't have much time.
Don't you feel stupid now?
Tom's phone can take pictures.
What do you want the message to be@@ ?
M@@ om said I caught a cold because I went out with w@@ et hair.
How many more for@@ ks do you need?
R@@ ar@@ ely have I met such a gr@@ ac@@ e@@ ful d@@ anc@@ er.
I've missed another chance.
I don't know how to contact you.
Do you want to join me for lun@@ ch@@ ?
All of these let@@ ters are addressed to you.
Tom knew where he had put his keys.
You could count to ten when you were two.
I just found it.
Tom is laughing.
Do you know what day it is today?
The poor cat was run over by a truck.
I don't want to get involved in that business.
There isn't any problem at all.
I was over@@ wh@@ el@@ me@@ d.
The boy was clever enough to solve the puzz@@ le.
I live with a por@@ cu@@ p@@ ine.
I appreciate your work.
The system is ri@@ gg@@ ed.
An arti@@ st must have an eye for col@@ our.
Oh w@@ ow@@ ! What's th@@ is, you're having lunch without me!
You sound tired.
Maybe Tom is in love.
Look at the met@@ er.
Thomas changed into proper clo@@ thing.
My mother bought two bottles of orange ju@@ ice.
T@@ aking everything into consi@@ der@@ ation@@ , the result is better than I expec@@ ted.
I guess right n@@ ine times out of ten.
That's a nice p@@ air of legs.
It is by this reason that he left school.
"@@ Have you fin@@ is@@ hed@@ ?" "@@ On the contr@@ ary. I haven't even star@@ te@@ d@@ ."
He doesn't like beef. Ne@@ ither do I@@ .
Where did you go to school?
Please don't dis@@ tr@@ act me from my work.
By teach@@ ing, we learn.
I tell you a little secret.
I'm not scared at all.
He was ac@@ compan@@ i@@ ed by his girlfriend.
His office is near the train station.
Tom was sitting under a tre@@ e, drinking wine.
I've been hoping to meet you.
Don't work too hard@@ !
Can you wash my je@@ ans?
Do you speak M@@ al@@ t@@ es@@ e?
I'm as curi@@ ous as you are.
Oh, how we laugh@@ ed!
What's your occup@@ ation?
That picture does not do justice to him.
Don't cut in while we're talking.
It's because I was asked to come that I'm here.
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
He is wise who ne@@ ither hop@@ es nor fear@@ s anything from the un@@ certain future.
Our class has twent@@ y-five boys and tw@@ enty girls.
Go away before they see you here.
I'm with them now.
Once I reti@@ re, I will de@@ di@@ cate my whole time to Tatoeba.
It's mer@@ ely a joke.
I do not have a sister.
Sam is two years younger than Tom.
May I borrow your bi@@ k@@ e?
What does your father like?
What a cat@@ as@@ tr@@ op@@ he@@ !
For the shar@@ ks, we saw them, not by un@@ it@@ s, nor by ten@@ s, nor by hun@@ dre@@ d@@ s@@ ; but by thous@@ ands and by my@@ ri@@ ad@@ s. T@@ r@@ ust me, there are more shar@@ ks in the sea than mor@@ tal@@ s on land.
You should get up early.
Lo@@ ve is terri@@ fied of everything that is not it@@ self.
He'll be back in ten.
If I wanted to s@@ care you, I would have told you about what I dream@@ t about a few weeks ago.
You're not dead yet.
I know a good restaurant that's in@@ expensive.
Who is the person in charg@@ e?
T@@ r@@ ying to find happin@@ ess only makes you un@@ happy.
I want to speak to a lawyer.
He av@@ eng@@ ed his dead father.
She liked that.
I'm so@@ re all over.
Why don't you sit down@@ ?
Stop show@@ ing off@@ !
The weather is very cold in Istanbu@@ l.
I'm doing you a fav@@ or.
You were afrai@@ d, weren't you?
I don't like the tas@@ te of on@@ ions.
They never returned to their country.
When do you mean to start?
Why do the stars tw@@ in@@ k@@ le?
When I came hom@@ e, he was watching TV.
She nam@@ ed him Char@@ les.
She s@@ ang better than him.
I made a proposal.
What do you plan on doing tonight?
I'm afraid you can't do that.
There is milk in the re@@ fri@@ g@@ er@@ ator.
I don't know her address.
I don't blame you for doing that.
I have a friend who lives in Kyoto.
I think you're too pick@@ y.
I opened the window to let in some fresh air.
I could not stop laughing.
P@@ res@@ s any key to contin@@ ue.
I'm not rac@@ ist.
The fi@@ re, dri@@ ven by an eas@@ t wind@@ , destro@@ yed the center of the city.
You look terri@@ fic@@ .
Sor@@ ry to have kept you waiting so long.
Of course I'll go.
This mountain is difficult to cli@@ mb@@ .
We needed this.
Can you think of a better way?
You've run out of things to drink.
Call me if you want to do something together tomorrow.
At what time are we going to get a bite to eat@@ , with all that?
Who's your most interesting friend@@ ?
Be n@@ ic@@ er to your brother.
Get the hel@@ l out of here!
I wasn't told that.
She broke the cu@@ p@@ , too.
One day he was walking along the stre@@ et.
We'll see each other again some@@ day.
They hid in the cel@@ l@@ ar@@ .
I'm a d@@ anc@@ er.
My father was a teacher.
I'm starting to feel des@@ perate.
The concert was a success.
Let's contin@@ ue where we left off yesterday.
I believe that this is not a good idea.
You were terri@@ fi@@ ed, weren't you?
Fin@@ ally he invited all and sun@@ dry to par@@ take of the cake and all.
Is this lake de@@ ep@@ ?
Se@@ a tur@@ t@@ les don't have teeth.
How are you taking it?
We live together.
Did it snow yesterday?
Are you from around here?
Where do you live?
No gif@@ t is more precious than trus@@ t.
You don't have to answer.
T@@ r@@ ang asked if she could share my bed.
My watch ran down and I didn't know the time.
They gre@@ et@@ ed me.
I would like to kiss you.
Have fun.
Are you in love with Layla@@ ?
He had a g@@ ent@@ l@@ eness that was attr@@ active to wom@@ en.
Ch@@ arg@@ e!
He likes tea.
Whose friend is he?
This morning I missed the 8@@ :@@ 30 train by five minutes.
This li@@ d is too ti@@ ght for me to open.
I have to go back to work.
Mike and Ken are friends.
You don't sound too sure.
A@@ in@@ '@@ t that cu@@ te?
They collected sh@@ ells on the beach.
What exactly did you say?
He set off to Paris.
The mess@@ en@@ g@@ er left for London in secret.
There's no way I'm going to work on Sunday.
It's hard for an old man to change his way of liv@@ ing.
A@@ i@@ r is a mi@@ x@@ ture of vari@@ ous gas@@ es.
M@@ is@@ understand@@ ings do oc@@ c@@ ur@@ .
Are you going to be OK?
What's going on with you? You haven't been talking to me for a while now.
You don't know anything about Istanbu@@ l.
She only worked for the s@@ ake of money.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
K@@ itt@@ y the cat gets in the car to go for a ri@@ de.
Does this story hold water?
Micha@@ el Jackson died.
Would you like to come to my party?
The hotel is on fire.
We expected him to support us.
Her behavior isn't normal for a young girl.
You didn't see nothing.
This room is too big.
These problems will be solved in the near future.
Sami's plane crashed in the fiel@@ d.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
I'm all set.
My computer won't start any more.
I've been in Boston for less than a month.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't speak French.
Did you find the difference between these two photo@@ s?
It seems that the rain@@ y seas@@ on has set in.
I told you that was ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous.
What was the color of the apple he gave you?
They surviv@@ ed, even though the building was destro@@ y@@ ed.
Who wants to go shop@@ p@@ ing?
He must have been crazy to say such a thing.
My heart was p@@ oun@@ ding as my turn got near@@ er.
That's not fai@@ r@@ ! You saw my cards in the mir@@ r@@ or@@ !
She was so beautiful that the mer@@ ch@@ ant@@ 's son could not help k@@ ne@@ eling down to kiss her hand.
I am laughing so that you will be happy.
If I knew you better, perhaps I would have let you in.
I want to go there once again.
I'm beginning to get used to doing this.
He wrote a book about his con@@ version to Is@@ l@@ am.
I found it in the at@@ tic.
I don't know how to contact you.
I invited her to a movie.
Tom says it as it is.
I'm sure you'll tell me what I want to know.
How is the weather there?
A mathemati@@ cal truth is ne@@ ither simple nor compli@@ cat@@ ed; it is.
He is studying history at the university.
He is such a show off.
Can I think about it?
This is the fin@@ al stru@@ gg@@ le.
They're very smart.
You accused him of having stolen the bike.
Why don't we talk for a while?
I helped my parents with the hou@@ se@@ work.
He knows Mr. D@@ av@@ id@@ son well.
Get back to where you started.
That is of no use to me.
Get me all the information you can on this matter.
I went to Boston by train.
Maybe Tom should pay more attention in class.
You were sleep@@ ing, weren't you?
There are no dr@@ u@@ g@@ s here.
That's what coun@@ ts.
They've crossed the border.
Give me the m@@ ic@@ ro@@ phone.
I never thought I'd see your face again.
We were playing ru@@ g@@ by.
I was born in 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 2 in A@@ th@@ ens, where I still live today.
I feel much saf@@ er now.
Tom notic@@ ed Mary's hands shak@@ ing.
Tomorro@@ w, I'll take the books to the library.
You must've been wrong.
Tom always sings in the shower.
Canadi@@ ans are our friends.
Leave that box where it is.
He's got a headache.
Were you born there?
Do you see a boat on the hor@@ i@@ z@@ on?
Let's decide together where to go first.
Please f@@ ill out this questi@@ on@@ n@@ ai@@ re and send it to us.
I want to be alone for a while.
This skirt is che@@ ap.
I'm playing with my friends.
I think you're right.
Don't che@@ at.
May I take your order@@ ?
I don't understand and I'm not used to not understanding. Please explain it once more.
Tom drank straight from the bottle.
S@@ tar@@ t at onc@@ e, or you will be late.
I ordered you a drink.
They have gone far away.
He probably didn't have sex with her.
Please call him up.
Hey, your dog just bit me.
I especially like your chocolate cake.
Tom is the tallest guy I've ever seen.
You should not go alone.
That's your du@@ ty.
The doctor advised that she take a holiday.
I've been sob@@ er for three years.
He will have no chance of win@@ ning her heart.
It's as old as the h@@ ills.
H@@ old this.
The hor@@ se is mine.
He could swim across the river when he was in his te@@ ens.
How many kids do you have?
Look at these pr@@ ic@@ es.
You're the lead@@ er.
I have little interest in history.
He studies ten hours a day on average.
I love you more and more each day.
It was surprising that she said that.
She doesn't drink.
I'd like to tell you something in private.
Do not inter@@ fer@@ e!
He took her in his arms.
You are ly@@ ing.
Are you certain that's what you want?
I don't think I can do this anymore.
They missed the de@@ ad@@ line.
He threw the letter into the fire.
The propos@@ al is accep@@ ted.
Get your mother.
You eat good meals in this board@@ ing@@ house.
What do you have in your hand@@ ?
I've known about this for years.
Tom jumped back just in time.
She bought a couple of boo@@ ts.
I teach here.
Were you really angr@@ y?
She denied having met him.
Stop cri@@ tici@@ zing me!
I would like to go, but I don't have a car.
He foo@@ led her.
Be nice.
I'm waiting for my friend.
I often sit up late at night to read.
I guess I'll have to think it over.
What's that picture inside your lo@@ ck@@ er?
Who's in command here?
Let@@ ters are deli@@ ver@@ ed every day.
Have you learned nothing from your mistak@@ es?
You'll understand it right away.
After ten years as business part@@ ner@@ s, they decided to part way@@ s.
Read as much as possible.
I have y@@ aw@@ ned.
I can't p@@ in@@ point the problem.
He put his hand to his fore@@ head.
I don't want to get you into trouble.
He is an exper@@ t at fishing.
I got this ty@@ pe@@ writ@@ er at a b@@ arg@@ ain price.

The hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter is so useful that some@@ day it may take the place of cars and tr@@ ain@@ s.
Tom sent Mary a lot of letters.
Are you enjo@@ ying your@@ self?
She had fun with him.
Tom lac@@ ks confid@@ ence in himself.
All men are equal under the law.
It's rather ir@@ on@@ ic.
I certainly have had great lu@@ ck.
He w@@ oke up in the middle of the night.
You sent the pack@@ age by plan@@ e.
The meat is tou@@ gh@@ .
Are you forget@@ fu@@ l?
I had a bad stom@@ ach@@ -@@ ache.
I'll give him your message when he comes.
Tom had no ally, but he himself was making different enem@@ ies.
Their married life was full blis@@ s.
I had a lot of help.
Maybe Tom has had an accident.
I'm aching to go to Australia.
Your pit@@ ching is far super@@ ior to mine.
I am trying to con@@ qu@@ er his heart.
I think the train will come soon.
You did what you had to do.
H@@ on@@ est@@ ly@@ ...
Do you know someone who knows about air conditi@@ on@@ ing?
You always were a good cook.
Mary is washing her hair.
I live in B@@ i@@ a@@ ł@@ y@@ sto@@ k.
No one will survi@@ ve.
This progr@@ am is brought to you by the sp@@ on@@ sors now appear@@ ing on your scre@@ en.
What do they sel@@ l?
Do you prefer blon@@ des or brun@@ et@@ tes?
You have no life.
She wrote him a long let@@ ter, but she didn't mail it.
She bl@@ ushed de@@ e@@ pl@@ y.
I do not understand you.
I won't accept that.
We haven't seen you for a long time.
I have to do it by myself.
Look out for pick@@ pock@@ ets.
I have to translate the sentences.
They came back last W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day.
They didn't tell us anything.
I hate women who say that all men are the sam@@ e.

She spoke in a weak voi@@ ce.
She has a large room all to her@@ self.
It's already dark outside.
Put the car@@ ro@@ ts in the pot.
I own this place.
My father died five years ago.
It's on me.

Ne@@ ither of them looks busy.
He disappear@@ ed without a tr@@ ac@@ e.
How do you like your new school?
He is washing a car.
The animal in the top lef@@ t-@@ hand cor@@ ner is meant to be a drag@@ on.
Tom answered the teacher@@ 's questions.
You're right, no doub@@ t about it.
You're very s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated.
I'm op@@ pos@@ ed to any type of war.
He did the work on his own.
Take a look at this m@@ ap.
We have to seriously think about this.
He denied having written to me.
Did you get enough sleep@@ ?
S@@ ever@@ al people lay woun@@ ded.
My father dri@@ ves a very old car.
The book is for me@@ ; the flowers are for us.
Please don't forget to put st@@ am@@ ps on the let@@ ters I gave you to pos@@ t.
Two women are singing.

It's 8@@ :@@ 3@@ 0.
A storm con@@ fin@@ ed them to the house.
Su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly, the super@@ vis@@ or lost his com@@ po@@ sure.

Lo@@ ve will pre@@ v@@ ail.
I got a kiss from him in respon@@ se.
I found this under your bed.
Come home before si@@ x.
I might be a few minutes late.
I'm not about to ask him.
Everybody took a ho@@ sti@@ le attitude toward illegal ali@@ ens.
I don't like to see food go to was@@ te.
Get away from me!
Please be careful.
He was involved in the trouble.
The prin@@ c@@ ess@@ 's tas@@ te for pleasures was exp@@ and@@ ing; and we thought only about how to sprin@@ k@@ le on them new seas@@ on@@ ings, so as to give them more sp@@ ice.
I forgot to do something.
Tom and Mary are both very hungry.
You're going in the wrong direction.
Tom was fired.
She be@@ gg@@ ed me to go with her.
Watch me do it!
I want this letter opened now.
Go warm up.

We'll work together.
Sami's a wai@@ ter at a gay bar.
I know that boy who is running.
One r@@ ol@@ l of color fil@@ m, please.
The great@@ er the difference between the nu@@ ll hypothesis and an out@@ com@@ e, and the larger the sam@@ ple si@@ z@@ e, the more confi@@ d@@ ent one can be that the out@@ come is me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful.
Let's see who can finish doing this first.
I think you might be over@@ re@@ ac@@ ting.
Where do you want to eat?
If I knew how to use a compu@@ ter, may@@ be they would pay me more.
Be@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ ful bir@@ d!
You can't do both at the same time.
I had to make a choice.
They were stupid not to follow your advice.
I forgot to bring my I@@ .@@ D@@ . card.
Do you want to know my secret@@ ? It's very simpl@@ e@@ ...
You need a drink.
I don't like sil@@ ence.
I was asked to wait here.
I want to write an article.
Tom is a play@@ er.
Why so g@@ lu@@ m?
A cold kept him in bed.
What would you like me to do?
Tom said that Mary looked exhausted.
She may have missed the train.
I didn't say I wasn't free.
I@@ ll@@ ness can often occur at a very incon@@ veni@@ ent time.
Are you with the F@@ B@@ I@@ ?
I worry about your health.

R@@ u@@ b@@ bish@@ !
We don't give a fu@@ ck.
It must've been extremely painful.
J@@ ill says that she's happ@@ ily marri@@ ed, but at times you'd never know it.
I am American.
My time is very expensive.
I was dis@@ may@@ ed at the news.
You're very open.
She tried to persuade him to buy her a pe@@ ar@@ l ne@@ ck@@ l@@ ac@@ e.
I actually am 8@@ 1 years old but if I sub@@ tr@@ act the time I've waited to get my bags at the air@@ por@@ t@@ , I'm only 4@@ 3@@ .
They're ignor@@ ing me.
I want you to stay here with her.
Sami is really un@@ lucky when it comes to wom@@ en.
Please give my re@@ gar@@ ds to your father.
No mechan@@ ical problems were f@@ ound.
This is not good at all.
Your gard@@ en needs some attention.
He felt in his pock@@ et for his ligh@@ ter.
What're you doing today?
You're part of the problem.
I was hoping that you'd know the answer.
Sami is a com@@ pu@@ l@@ si@@ ve liar.
He wants to kill me.
The baby is sleeping.
What do you like about her?
I'm not here to buy shoes.
You'll have to do that on your own.
Did anybody see you?
How does he think it w@@ ent?
Let's be careful.
The students were ill at ease before the exam.
Push the door open.
Who listen@@ s to Tom?
Do you know anyone wh@@ o@@ 's not on F@@ ac@@ eb@@ ook@@ ?
How much does an egg cost?
That's why I'm here.
Nobody answered the door.
It's hard to get a taxi outside the station.
She made mistake after mistake.
These mo@@ tor@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ les are the same ty@@ pe.
According to the pap@@ er, there was a big fire in Boston.
Everyone looked reliev@@ ed.
St@@ ret@@ ch your arm@@ s str@@ ai@@ ght.
You can't have bo@@ th.
There's nothing up here.
How is the word pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce@@ d?
Our cat is st@@ er@@ ili@@ z@@ ed.
